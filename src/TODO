# The file contais the tasks that have to be done in the future
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								FILE DESCRIPTION:
# The file is devided into few groups by its ranks
	# A rank can have the following type:
		- [ Super High ]
		- [ High ]
		- [ Middle ]
		- [ Low ]
		- [ Super Low ]
	# Each rank can contain priorities. It's usually represented by an integer
	  number. The priority just show what task has to be executed at first
	  within the rank 

# Each line has to contain several tags, namely:
	1. Rank
	2. Priority
	3. Message - a short text explaing what has to be done for the next update

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ High ] [ 1 ] the proper Exception Handling has to be devised based on 
			   the OOP paradigm 

[ High ] [ 2 ] the Matrix and Vector classes has to unit tested

[ High ] [ 3 ] the sparse solver has to be embedded 

[ Middle ] [ 1 ] At least 65% of code has to be unit tested

[ Middle ] [ 2 ] Check the operation such copying and assignment for memory leaks

[ Middle ] [ 3 ] Expand the code to handle Structure Mechanics in 2D

[ Low ] [ 1 ] Make comparison with ANSYS
